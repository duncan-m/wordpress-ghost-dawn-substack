# wordpress-ghost-dawn-substack
Child theme for TwentyTwentyOne inspired by Ghost and Substack. I quite liked the minimal list style from ghost as well as the really tidy commments on substack. 

If you're reading this and you're from a platform I'd love to have: 
- Approval for all users to get access on a free or paid plan, my content is sensitive so I can't have anyone gaining access
- Some posts that show previews to visitors and all to google
- Some posts that show preivews to visitors and only the preview to google
- Some posts completely private

Right now only way I could do it was spend two days messing around with WP.

## Installation & Set-up

- Copy the child theme to /wp-content/themes/
- Activate the theme
- Go to Appearance => Customise => Colors & Dark mode => Change background color to whatever you like
